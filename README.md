# K-Means Clustering Algorithm Implementation

![Cluster Visualization Example](cluster_visualization.png) *(Optional: Add an image if available)*

## Description
This project implements the **K-Means Clustering** algorithm from scratch in Python. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions a dataset into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity, minimizing intra-cluster variance while maximizing inter-cluster distance.

## Objectives
- Understand the concept and working of the K-Means Clustering algorithm
- Implement K-Means from scratch using Python
- Visualize and interpret clustering results on a 2D dataset
- Evaluate the algorithm's performance

## Features
- Random dataset generation
- Manhattan distance metric implementation
- Iterative centroid optimization
- 2D matrix visualization of clusters
- Customizable parameters (grid size, cluster count, iterations)

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/k-means-implementation.git
cd k-means-implementation
